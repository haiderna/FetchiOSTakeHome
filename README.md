# FetchiOSTakeHome
The fetch app is a simple assessment application that allows users to view a list of desserts from the https://themealdb.com/api.php api and click on certain recipes to see the details such as meal name, instructions, and ingredients. The app is built on MVVM architecture with SwiftUI

### Installation 
This app was created on Xcode 14.2 on Ventura but should be able to run on XCode 15 without any issues. 

### Testing
Included with the project are unit test for the Desserts View and the Meal Detail view, under their respective folders in FetchiOSTakeHomeTests.
